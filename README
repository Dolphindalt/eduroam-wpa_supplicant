A sample wpa_supplicant configuration file for eduroam
======================================================

To use, change identity and password to your eduroam account.

Quick and dirty start-up:

$ sudo wpa_supplicant -Diwlwifi -iwlp3s0 -c supplicant.conf

  Where iwlwifi is the kernel driver stated for your wireless card. (wext is a
  deprecated driver that often works as well.) You can find your standard
  driver using lspci:

  $ lspci -k

  wlp3s0 is the network interface name for your wireless card. You can find
  this using ip link:

  $ ip link

  Optionally, use the -B to move the wpa_supplicant process to background.

  Additionaly, start up dhcpcd if it doesn't start automatically.
